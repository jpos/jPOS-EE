Many jPOS-EE applications use Hibernate (R) as its supporting
Object/Relational mapping engine.

Database support is enabled by adding a database backend dependency module to
your project.

For MySQL:
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jpos.ee</groupId>
        <artifactId>jposee-db-mysql</artifactId>
        <version>${jposee.version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

For PostgreSQL:
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jpos.ee</groupId>
        <artifactId>jposee-db-postgresql</artifactId>
        <version>${jposee.version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

For H2 Embedded database:
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jpos.ee</groupId>
        <artifactId>jposee-db-h2</artifactId>
        <version>${jposee.version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

WARNING: Only one of these dependencies should defined in your project.

|=================================================================
|*What:*| This module configures Hibernate to use MySQL as its back end.
|*When:*| Available in all versions of jPOS-EE.
|*Who:* |The jPOS.org team.
|*How:* |Posted by the jPOS-EE team.
|*Where:*| Directory modules/db-mysql available in the jPOS-EE GitHub repository.
|*Why:* | An RDBMS back end is required by Hibernate.
|*Status:* | Stable.
|*License:* | The jPOS-EE code related to this module is licensed under the

Upon running 'setup', your runtime directory will contain a file: cfg/db.properties.

[source,ini]

----
<1> Replace value with your database username
<2> Replace value with your database password
<3> Makes hibernate automatically update the contents of the DB to match
    the entities defined. This is good to keep during development, but should
    be set to *NONE* in a production environment.
<4> Replace the host and database (jposee) to match your database settings.

NOTE: You want to change those defaults.
