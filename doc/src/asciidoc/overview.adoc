== Project Overview

=== Background

Back in the late nineties, our company was awarded the development of a
jPOS-based application for our local VISANet footnote:[Visanet/Uruguay http://visanet.com.uy]
acquirer.

At that time, we thought that going for a J2EE solution was the way to
go. We went with the great Orion application server and we called the application
*jPOS-EE*, it was kind of a jPOS "Enterprise" Edition.

But we soon got to hit some of the major problems of running an early
J2EE application in a demanding 7x24x365 environment, the deployment of
new versions was both stressful and costly in terms of time (a one
minute downtime can feel like a week when you are manning the telephones
 in a call center). So we designed a lightweight solution that we could
deploy and redeploy quickly, without obscure RMI-IIOP related issues
that could only be solved with an application server restart.

In addition, we started to see how O/R mapping tools such as Hibernate
offered greater sophistication than EJB 2.1 could offer, and EJB 3.0 was
not on the horizon yet.

So we decided to build our own tiny environment and began by building
*Q2*, our JMX-based IoC micro kernel. footnote:[Q2 is QSP version 2, described in the jPOS
Programmer's Guide]

We consider jPOS-EE as a *Meta-Project* where we encompass many other
compatible (from a technical as well as license perspective) Open Source
projects such as:

* Hibernate
* Jetty
* Velocity
* XStream
* JDOM
* JDBM
* Apache Commons
* Etcetera

In order to easily assemble different types of jPOS-EE applications
whilst fostering code reuse as much as possible, we have developed a
very simple, module-based jPOS-EE Software Development Kit (jPOS-EE
SDK), now replaced by Gradle footnote:[Gradle Project http://gradle.org/].

We kept the name jPOS-EE, but we replaced the first E from Enterprise to
Extended. This document describes the *jPOS Extended Edition*.

We don't claim that using the jPOS-EE framework and our choice of
supporting projects is the best way to write a jPOS application, people
could argue that JEE is the way to go, or Spring is the way to go, or
Pico/Nano container does better IoC, or that we should use
JBoss/Jeronimo, Guice, OSGI, QI4J, you name
it. In the same way, we choose to use Jetty but there's people that may
say that Tomcat is the way to go.

jPOS-EE is just the way we at jPOS.org write our applications and we are
sharing this "technology" on an as-is basis. You can use it, or you can
write your jPOS application using whatever technology/framework you feel
more comfortable with.

=== About this document

This is the official jPOS-EE documentation that intends to
aggregate everything related to jPOS-EE, including but no limited to:
its objectives, specifications, schedule, priorities, organizational
chart, road map, change log, coding conventions, core modules, optional
modules, license information, etc.

It complements, but doesn't replace the
http://jpos.org/products/proguide[jPOS Programmer's Guide]. It is not a
user guide nor a tutorial, it is a development master workbook, written
by developers for developers.

New versions of this document are regularly posted in

=== Objectives

Our main objective is to avoid repeating ourselves. *DRY*
footnote:[Do not repeat yourself] is a good paradigm to keep in mind.

We at jPOS.org have a small company with very limited development
resources and a large number of customers. Most of our end user
applications are very specific, yet they share a large number of
features.

jPOS-EE is all about code reuse. We developed a very simple SDK based on
a pluggable module architecture that can be bundled together at compile
time to create -- as fast as possible -- highly reliable jPOS
applications.

The more we use jPOS-EE to create applications for our customers, the
more we tend to make these modules smaller, with as few
dependencies on each other as possible.

We expect developers using jPOS-EE to create their own modules based
upon our public ones, and to interact with the jPOS-EE community in
order to engage into the formal process of requesting changes to the jPOS-EE
codebase whenever it is deemed necessary.

[TIP]
========================================================================
Local changes to the jPOS-EE code base may seem the easy way to solve a
given requirement, but it forces you to apply the same change over and
over as new jPOS-EE versions become available.

We encourage you to go the formal route and send us a pull request
that can be included in jPOS-EE, reviewed by other jPOS-EE developers,
tested in multiple platforms and disparate environments, properly
documented and maintained in future releases.

We strongly recommend you to review our license terms before using jPOS

The AGPL covers applications that runs over the network (SaaS) such as
most credit/debit card verification/authorization systems like those
deployed by most people using jPOS, meaning that you probably need a
commercial license.

=== Getting involved

jPOS-EE is a centralized open source project. jPOS.org retain full
control of the release cycle because the code placed in the jposee
repository is regularly checked out by our production customers.

Whilst we have experimental modules, and a sandbox/incoming area where
we can put alpha and even PoC code, there are fundamental modules that
we use over and over at production sites. These modules may have been
audited or even certified by third parties and we can't afford to modify
them without being absolutely sure of their impact in the rest of the systems.

That said, we are very happy to accept contributions, and publish them
for review by the jPOS-EE community.

We license jPOS-EE commercially, so companies or individuals willing to
include code in the jPOS-EE distribution will need to sign a CLA (see
<<appendix_CLA>>) and
if working for a company, a CCLA agreement (see <<appendix_CCLA>>) as well.
